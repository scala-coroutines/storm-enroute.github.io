## Bug Reports

Please submit bug reports and feature requests at our
[issue tracker at GitHub](https://github.com/storm-enroute/macrogl/issues).
We'll be happy to take a look!

When submitting a bug report, you can help us fix the issue quicker
by submitting a **minimal**, **standalone**, **reproducible** and
**complete** example code and error information.
This has several advantages:

- **Minimal:** the bug report contains the smallest possible snippet of code
  that triggers the bug.
  This makes it easier and faster to understand the cause of the bug.
- **Standalone:** the error report does not require any external dependencies, and the
  code can be run directly (modulo imports, unless relevant to the bug).
- **Reproducible:** the bug should be reproducible between different runs if possible.
- **Complete:** the error report should contain all the relevant information.
  For example, if there is a compilation error or a stack trace associated with
  compiling or running the relevant code snippet, please include it. Please include the
  Scala, JVM and OS version, as well.

And feel free to submit a patch yourself! :)

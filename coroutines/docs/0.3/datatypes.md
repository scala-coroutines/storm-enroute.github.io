Scala Coroutines are *first-class*.
That means that a coroutine definition is a value that can be passed to other
functions and coroutines as arguments, much like ordinary function objects can.
This property allows abstracting over implementations of a coroutine.
In this part of the guide, we will learn about coroutine data types
that make this possible.


## Basic coroutine types

A coroutine definition is defined by ...


## Syntactic sugar

TODO

We will consider a program that defines ...

<div>
<pre id="examplebox-1">
</pre>
</div>
<script>
  setContent(
    "examplebox-1",
    "https://api.github.com/repos/storm-enroute/coroutines/contents/src/test/scala/scala/examples/Datatypes.scala",
    null,
    "raw",
    "https://github.com/storm-enroute/coroutines/blob/master/src/test/scala/scala/examples/Datatypes.scala");
</script>

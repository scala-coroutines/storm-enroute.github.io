In this part of the guide,
we will explain what coroutines are,
how to create them and use some basic coroutine operations.
If you did not setup a project that uses Scala Coroutines, please go through the
[Setup and Dependencies](../setup/).
Otherwise, please proceed with the next section.


## Coroutines 101

A *coroutine* is a programming construct that can suspend its execution
and resume execution later.
*Subroutines* (i.e. functions, procedures or methods) are well known
and available in most programming languages.
For the purposes of this guide, we will jointly refer to functions, procedures, methods
and lambdas as subroutines, despite their subtle differences.
When a subroutine is called,
its execution begins at the start of the subroutine definition,
and finishes when the end of the subroutine is reached.
A coroutine is more powerful -- it can pause execution at any point between the start
and the end of the coroutine definition.
In this sense, coroutines generalize subroutines.

To better understand how coroutines work,
we contrast them to lambdas from functional programming.
Consider the following definition of an identity lambda:

    val id = (x: Int) => x

We call (i.e. invoke) the identity lambda `id` as follows:

    id(7)

When `id` is invoked, the following sequence of events occurs.
First, the runtime allocates a location on the program stack to hold the parameter `x`.
Then, the value of `x` is copied to this location.

![ ](/resources/images/invoke.png)

The `id` body then simply returns the value `x` back to the caller
by copying it back to the appropriate location.
After that, the invocation of `id` (i.e. an *instance* of the subroutine `id`)
completes.

![ ](/resources/images/invoke1.png)

Above, the caller of the `id` lambda (e.g. the main program) must suspend execution
until `id` completes.
After `id` returns control to the caller, the instance of the subroutine
`id` no longer exists, so it does not make sense to be able to refer to it.
An invocation (i.e. *an instance of a subroutine*) is therefore
not a first-class object.

By contrast, a coroutine invocation can suspend its execution before it completes,
and later be resumed.
For this reason, it makes sense to represent the coroutine invocation
(i.e. a *coroutine instance*) as a first-class object
that can be passed to and returned from functions,
whose execution state can be retrieved,
and which can be resumed when required.

Let's see the simplest possible coroutine definition -- an *identity coroutine*,
which just returns the argument that is passed to it.
Its definition is similar to that of an identity lambda,
the only difference being the enclosing `coroutine` block:

    val id = coroutine { (x: Int) => x }

Here, the difference between a *coroutine definition*
and a *coroutine instance* becomes more prominent.
We cannot create and get a hold of a coroutine instance
simultaneously with obtaining its return value,
so starting a coroutine is a two step process.
First, a coroutine is instantiated with the `call` keyword,
which returns a coroutine instance object.
Second, a coroutine instance is started by calling its `resume` method:

    val c = call(id(7))
    c.resume
    assert(c.result == 7)

Above, we first use the `call` keyword to create
an `id` coroutine instance called `c`.
This coroutine instance object `c` is created in a suspended state,
and is resumed by calling `c.resume`.
To obtain the resulting value from the coroutine, we call `c.result`.
The `assert` statement is used here to verify that the return value
is really what we expect.
Importantly, the same coroutine definition can be reused to create many coroutine
instances, much like a lambda can be invoked more than once.

<table class="docs-tip">
<td><img src="/resources/images/warning.png"/></td>
<td>
A coroutine is <b>defined</b> once by passing a lambda literal
to the special <code>coroutine</code> block.
A coroutine is <b>invoked</b> by passing an invocation expression
to the <code>call</code> keyword,
which returns a fresh <b>coroutine instance</b>.
</td>
</table>

Note that we are explicit about invoking the coroutine `id`
with the `call` construct, to signify that this creates
a fresh coroutine instance.
Also, note that we use the term *invocation* and *instance* interchangeably
to refer to starting a coroutine.

The complete, standalone example snippet is shown below:

<div>
<pre id="examplebox-1">
</pre>
</div>
<script>
  setContent(
    "examplebox-1",
    "https://api.github.com/repos/storm-enroute/coroutines/contents/src/test/scala/org/examples/Identity.scala",
    null,
    "raw",
    "https://github.com/storm-enroute/coroutines/blob/master/src/test/scala/org/examples/Identity.scala");
</script>

Although this particular coroutine `id` is semantically equivalent
to the prior definition of the identity lambda `id`,
its execution is slightly different.
A coroutine instance does not execute on the same program stack as the caller.
Instead, it maintains a separate highly optimized stack,
used to store its execution state,

![ ](/resources/images/invoke2.png)

The `id` coroutine is so simple that it does not even suspend execution
after it starts.
The only point when it is suspended
is immediately after its instance is created.
Therefore, this particular coroutine does not even require a state stack.
We will study more complex coroutines next.


## Yielding with coroutines 

To understand why a separate stack is required,
we will study a more complex coroutine
that takes a string and yields counts of different vowels in that string.
To yield control and a value back to the caller,
coroutines use the special `yieldval` statement.
Consider the following example.

<div>
<pre id="examplebox-2">
</pre>
</div>
<script>
  setContent(
    "examplebox-2",
    "https://api.github.com/repos/storm-enroute/coroutines/contents/src/test/scala/org/examples/VowelCount.scala",
    null,
    "raw",
    "https://github.com/storm-enroute/coroutines/blob/master/src/test/scala/org/examples/VowelCount.scala");
</script>

Above, we define a coroutine called `vowelcounts`,
which takes a `String` parameter.
This coroutine then calls the `count` method on `String` a total of five times,
each time for a different vowel character.
It uses the `yieldval` statement five times to suspend execution
and yield the count to the main program.
Each time `yieldval` is called, the coroutine execution is paused,
and control is returned to the caller.
The caller then calls `resume` on the coroutine instance `c` to resume the coroutine.

It is illegal to call `resume` on an already completed coroutine instance --
doing this raises an exception.


### Summary

To summarize, there are four important coroutine operations
you need to remember:

- `coroutine` -- used to define a coroutine, e.g. `coroutine { (x: Int) => x }`
- `call` -- used to invoke a coroutine, i.e. to start a coroutine instance
- `resume` -- used to resume a paused coroutine
- `yieldval` -- used only inside a coroutine to suspend execution and yield a value
  to the caller

And that's it -- you already know everything you need
to get productive with coroutines.
You can now start coding,
or continue to the next section,
where we learn about the [coroutine data types](../datatypes).
